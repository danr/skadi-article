\begin{abstract}
We present a new symbolic evaluation method for functional programs that generates input to a SAT-solver. The result is a bounded model checking method for functional programs that can find concrete inputs that cause the program to produce certain outputs, or show the inexistence of such inputs under certain bounds. SAT-solvers have long been used for bounded model checking of hardware and also low-level software. This paper presents the first method for SAT-based bounded model checking for high-level programs containing recursive algebraic datatypes and unlimited recursion. Our method works {\em incrementally}, i.e. it increases bounds on inputs until it finds a solution. We also present a novel optimization

\section{Introduction}

SAT-based Bounded Model Checking for hardware, revolution.

Finding {\em counter examples}, {\em examples}, {\em inverting functions}, for prototype programming, primarily. Also: see Reach paper. Secondarily, for showing their absence.

Bounded Model Checking for C. Difference here: recursive data structures. Doing this by modelling pointers and the heap does not work.

Motivating example: Finding 2 different inputs for which a show function returns the same result.

QuickCheck, need to write generators, cannot find intricate examples where things have to correspond.

SmallCheck, only for very small examples, depth bound. FEAT is not depth bound, still size limit.

Lazy narrowing, (e.g. Lazy SmallCheck, Lindblad, Reach), exploit the lazy structure of programs + backtracking. Still not good enough for combinatorial search. Could be adapted to

Old text:

Bounded model checking for hardware has been a great success. Idea: find bugs efficiently, and show absence of bugs up to size bound, exploiting efficient search in SAT-solvers.

This paper we want to bring this power to function programming.

Example of use (sorting).

Motivational talk about in what situations to use this: (1) Instead of QuickCheck/SmallCheck. Gain: no complicated generators. (2) Computing inverses in programming / prototype programs. (3) FP as a metalanguage for generating constraints, to solve a problem.

This paper contains the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
\item We present a monad for constraint generation that can be used to generate constraints for a SAT-solver.

\item We show how to express values of arbitrary datatypes symbolically in a SAT-solver.

\item We show how a program containing recursive functions over datatypes can be symbolically executed, resulting in a SAT-problem.

\item We show how we can battle certain kinds of exponential blow-up that naturally happen in symbolic evaluation, by means of a novel program transformation.

\item We show to perform bounded model checking {\em incrementally} for growing input sizes, by making use of feedback from the SAT-solver.
\end{itemize}

\section{Main Idea}

\comment{Perhaps this section should be merged with the intro.}

The programming language FL, part of the formal verification system Forte \cite{forte} is an ML-like language with one particular distinghuishing feature: symbolic booleans. FL has a primitive function with the following type\footnote{Throughout the paper, we use Haskell notation for our examples, even though the examples may not actually be written in the Haskell language.}:
\begin{code}
var :: String -> Bool
\end{code}
The idea behind |var| is that it creates a symbolic boolean value with the given name. It is possible to use the normal boolean operators (|(/\)|, |(\/)|, |(not)|, |(==)|, etc.) on these symbolic booleans, and the result is then computed as a normalized boolean formula in terms of the variables created by |var|. The implementation of FL uses BDDs \cite{bdd} for this.

%format BoolSym = "\mathit{Bool}^\dagger"
What happens when we use \ifthenelse{} with these symbolic booleans to choose between, for example, two given lists? This is unfortunately disallowed in FL, and leads to a run-time error. The Haskell library Duct Logic \cite{duct-logic} provided a similar feature to FL, but used the type system to avoid mixing symbolic booleans with regular Haskell values, by making symbolic booleans |BoolSym| a different type from regular |Bool|.

This paper aims to lift this restriction, and allow for all values in the program to be symbolic.
The problem that an expression such as
\begin{code}
if var "a" then [1] else []
\end{code}
presents is that at symbolic evaluation time, we cannot decide what constructor to return. One of our main ideas in this paper is to transform algebraic datatypes with several constructors, such as for example:
\begin{code}
data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
\end{code}
into algebraic with one constructor which is the ``superposition state'' of all possible constructors, that contains enough symbolic boolean variables to decide which constructor we actually have, plus a ``superposition'' of all possible arguments. Here is what we could do for lists:
%format ListSym = "\mathit{List}^\dagger"
%format FalseSym = "\mathit{False}^\dagger"
%format TrueSym = "\mathit{True}^\dagger"
\begin{code}
data ListSym a = NilCons BoolSym (Maybe (a, ListSym a))

nil :: ListSym a
nil = NilCons FalseSym Nothing

cons :: a -> ListSym a -> ListSym a
cons x xs = NilCons TrueSym (Just (x, xs))
\end{code}
Here, |Maybe| is the regular Haskell datatype, not the symbolic datatype. A symbolic list is thus always built using the |NilCons| constructor. The first argument (a symbolic bool) indicates which constructor we are using (|False| for |Nil|, |True| for |Cons|), and the second argument contains the arguments to the |Cons| constructor (which are only used in the case when we actually have a |Cons| constructor).

An extra datatype invariant has to be respected. For |ListSym| it is that whenever it is possible for the constructor to be |True|, the second argument cannot be |Nothing|.

What have we gained from this? It is now possible to implement \ifthenelse{} on lists, in terms of \ifthenelse{} on symbolic booleans and list elements. Here is the implementation:
%format c1
%format c2
%format ma1
%format ma2
\begin{code}
if b then NilCons c1 ma1 else NilCons c2 ma2 =
  NilCons  (if b then c1   else c2)
           (if b then ma1  else ma2)
\end{code}
We also need \ifthenelse{} on the regular |Maybe| type, which in a symbolic setting is only used to indicate the presence or absence of constructor arguments:
%format a1
%format a2
\begin{code}
if b then Nothing  else ma2      = ma2
if b then ma1      else Nothing  = ma1
if b then Just a1  else Just a2  =
  Just (if b then a1 else a2)
\end{code}
If one branch does not have arguments, we choose the other side. If both branches have arguments, we choose between them.

How can we do |case|-expressions on these symbolic lists? It turns out having \ifthenelse{} on the result type is enough. If we have a |case|-expression:
\begin{code}
case xs of
  Nil        -> a
  Cons y ys  -> f (y,ys)
\end{code}
we can translate it to work on symbolic lists as follows:
\begin{code}
let NilCons c ma = xs in
  if c then f (fromJust ma) else a
\end{code}
In this way, the user can use boolean variables to create a symbolic input to a program, for example representing all lists up to a particular length, containing elements up to a particular size, and run the program. The output will be another symbolic expression, about which we can ask questions. For example, if we want to do property checking, the output will be a symbolic boolean, and we can ask if it can ever be |FalseSym|.

In the remainder of the paper we will use the main idea described in this section, with a number of changes. Firstly, we are going to use a SAT-solver instead of BDDs. Also, we want to create inputs to the program {\em incrementally}, without deciding up-front how large the inputs should be.
For these reasons, we move from an {\em expression-based} view (using \ifthenelse{}) to a {\em constraint-based} view.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{A DSL for generating constraints}

In this section, we present a small DSL that we will use later to generate constraints to a SAT-solver. We also show how it can be used to encode algebraic datatypes symbolically.

\subsection{The Constraint monad}

We start by explaining the API of the monad we use to generate constraints. We make use of an abstract type |Prop|, that represents propositional logic formulas. (The type |Prop| plays the same role as the type |BoolSym| above.)
%format /\ = "\wedge"
%format \/ = "\vee"
%format ==> = "\Rightarrow"
%format <=> = "\Leftrightarrow"
%format nt = "\neg"
\begin{code}
type Prop

(/\), (\/), (==>), (<=>)  :: Prop -> Prop -> Prop
(nt)                      :: Prop -> Prop
true, false               :: Prop
\end{code}
Note however that there is no way to create a variable with a given name of type |Prop|. Variable creation happens inside the constraints generating monad |C|, using the function |newVar|:
\begin{code}
type C a
instance Monad C

newVar  :: C Prop
insist  :: Prop -> C ()
when    :: Prop -> C () -> C ()
\end{code}
Once we have created a proposition that we want to state as a constraint on variables that has to hold, we can use the function |insist|.

The |C| monad also provides a way of keeping track of local assumptions, by means of |when|. The expression |when a m| generates all constraints that are generated by |m|, but they will only hold conditionally under |a|. To explain better what |when| does, consider the following equivalences:
%format === = "\Longleftrightarrow"
\begin{code}
when a (insist b)  ===  insist (a ==> b)
when a (m >>= k)   ===  when a m >>= (when a . k)
when a (when b m)  ===  when (a /\ b) m
when false m       ===  return ()
\end{code}
These are logical equivalences, i.e.\ the expressions on the left and right hand side may generate syntactically different sets of constraints, but they are logically equivalent.

|C| can be thought of as a reader monad in the condition, a writer monad in the constraints, and a state monad in variable identifiers. In reality, it is implemented on top of a SAT-solver (in our case, we are using MiniSat \cite{minisat}). The function |newVar| simply creates a new variable in the solver, |insist| generates clauses from a given proposition and the environment condition, and |when| conjoins its proposition argument with the current environment condition to generate the environment for its second argument.

\subsection{Finite choice}

In order to help us define the translation from algebraic datatypes to monadic constraint generating code, we introduce the following abstraction. The type |Fin a| represents a symbolic choice between finitely many concrete values of type |a|.
\begin{code}
newtype Fin a = Fin [(Prop,a)]

newFin :: Eq a => [a] -> C (Fin a)
newFin xs = do  ps <- sequence [ newVal | x <- nub xs ]
                insist (exactlyOne ps)
                return (Fin (ps `zip` nub xs))

one :: a -> Fin a
one x = Fin [(true,x)]

is :: Eq a => Fin a -> a -> Prop
Fin pxs `is` x = head ([p | (p,y) <- pxs, x == y] ++ [false])
\end{code}
The function |newFin| creates a suitable number of new variables, uses a proposition function that creates a formula expressing that exactlyOne of its arguments is true, and returns |Fin a| value which relates the values from |xs| to the corresponding propositional variables. The function |one| creates a |Fin a| with only one option. The function |is| selects the proposition belonging to the given value.

\subsection{Incrementality}

Before we show the symbolic encoding of datatypes in the constraint generation setting, we need to introduce one more auxiliary type. Since we are going to create symbolic inputs to programs {\em incrementally}, i.e.\ without knowing on beforehand how large they should be, we introduce the type |Delay|.
\begin{code}
type Delay a

delay  :: C a -> C (Delay a)
done   :: a -> Delay a
force  :: Delay a -> C a
wait   :: Delay a -> (a -> C ()) -> C ()
\end{code}
Using the function |delay|, we can created a delayed computation of type |Delay a|, which will be executed at most once. For convenience, the function |done| also creates a delayed computation, but one which is already done.
Using |force|, we can make a delayed computation happen. Using |wait|, we can make code wait for a delayed computation to happen, and react to it by executing its second argument.

The way |Delay| is implemented is the standard way lazy thunks are implemented in an imperative setting, by using |IORef|s, as follows:
\begin{code}
data Delay a  =  Done a
              |  Delay (IORef (Either (IO ()) a))
\end{code}
In the next subsection, we will see how |Delay| is used.

\subsection{Symbolic datatypes}

In the previous section, we saw how we could make an algebraic datatype symbolic by creating one constructor that is the ``superposition'' of all constructors, with arguments (1) a symbolic value indicating which constructor we have, and (2) the union of all possible arguments to the constructors.

In this subsection, we show how to do this in our constraint-based setting, by example, and using a different datatype, namely of arithmetic expressions:
\begin{code}
data Expr a  =  Var a
             |  Add (Expr a) (Expr a)
             |  Mul (Expr a) (Expr a)
             |  Neg (Expr a)
\end{code}
The first thing we need to do to create a symbolic version of this datatype
is to make a new datatype representing the choice of constructors:
\begin{code}
data ExprL = Var | Add | Mul | Neg deriving ( Eq )
\end{code}
The second thing we do is to merge all constructor arguments into one symbolic constructor:
%format ExprSym = "\mathit{Expr}^\dagger"
\begin{code}
data Arg a    = X | An a

data ExprC s  = Expr (Fin ExprL)  (Arg a)
                                  (Arg (ExprSym a))
                                  (Arg (ExprSym a))
\end{code}
The new constructor |Expr| has one argument of type |Fin ExprL| that indicates (symbolically) which constructor we are using. The other arguments are the (multi-set) union of all arguments that are used by any of the original constructors. We use the type |Arg|, which is isomorphic to the Haskell |Maybe| type to indicate that some arguments may not always be present.
In the merged constructor |Expr|, we reuse argument positions as much as possible; for example the first arguments of |Add|, |Mul|, and |Minus| are all represented by one argument of the symbolic |Expr| constructor.

We are assuming a datatype invariant that guarantees that an |Arg| argument is not |X| when it is possible that the constructor argument 

Finally, we define the actual type of symbolic expressions, by using the |Delay| type:
\begin{code}
type ExprSym a = Delay (ExprC a)
\end{code}
A symbolic expression is thus an object that can potentially create a choice of constructors, plus the choice of arguments, which in turn can be symbolic expressions again.

All recursive types have to use the |Delay| constructor, because in general we cannot know in advance what the size is. With |Delay|, we can delay this decision until later, when we see what happens when we evaluate the program.

For convenience, we create the following helper functions that represent the old constructor functions:
\begin{code}
var       :: a -> ExprSym a
add, mul  :: ExprSym a -> ExprSym a -> ExprSym a
neg       :: ExprSym a -> ExprSym a

var x    = done (Expr (one Var) (An a)  X       X)
add a b  = done (Expr (one Add) X       (An a)  (An b))
mul a b  = done (Expr (one Add) X       (An a)  (An b))
neg a    = done (Expr (one Neg) X       (An a)  X)
\end{code}
%format TypeSym = "\mathit{Type}^\dagger"
In general, to make a symbolic version of an algebraic datatype |Type|, we create three new types: |TypeL|, which enumerates all constructor functions from |Type|; |TypeC|, which has one argument |Fin TypeL| and moreover the union of all constructor arguments tagged with |Arg|, and |TypeSym|, which is just |Delay TypeC|. Note that this construction also works for mutally recursive datatypes.

We have seen how to construct concrete values in these symbolic datatypes. What is left is to show how to do case analysis on symbolic datatypes, how to construct symbolic values, and how to state equality between . This is presented in the next two subsections.

\subsection{Case expressions on symbolic datatypes}

In a regular case analysis, three things happen: (1) the scrutinee is evaluated, (2) the constructor is examined to make a choice between branches, and (3) the arguments of the constructor are bound in the correct branch.

On symbolic datatypes, we split case analysis in three parts as well. However, our case analysis is {\em passive}; it does not demand any evaluation, instead it will wait until another part of the program defines the scrutinee, and then generate constraints.

To examine which constructor we have, we introduce the following helper functions:
\begin{code}
isVar, isAdd, isMul, isNeg :: ExprC a -> Prop
isVar  (Expr c _ _ _)  = c `is` Var
isAdd  (Expr c _ _ _)  = c `is` Add
isMul  (Expr c _ _ _)  = c `is` Mul
isNeg  (Expr c _ _ _)  = c `is` Neg
\end{code}
And to project out relevant arguments, we use the following projection functions:
%format sel1
%format sel2
%format sel3
\begin{code}
sel1 :: ExprC a -> a
sel2 :: ExprC a -> ExprSym a
sel3 :: ExprC a -> ExprSym a

sel1 (Expr _ (An x) _ _)  = x
sel2 (Expr _ _ (An a) _)  = a
sel3 (Expr _ _ _ (An b))  = b
\end{code}
Note that the $\mathit{sel}_i$ functions are partial; we should not use them when the corresponding arguments do not exist.
Now, to express a case expression of the following form on a symbolic datatype:
%format P1
%format P2
%format P3
%format P4
%format //- = "\!"
\begin{code}
case e of
  Var x    -> P1//-[x]
  Add a b  -> P2//-[a,b]
  Mul a b  -> P3//-[a,b]
  Neg a    -> P4//-[a]
\end{code}
We write the following:
\begin{code}
wait e ยง \ec ->
  do  when (isVar ec)  ยง  P1//-[sel1 ec]
      when (isAdd ec)  ยง  P2//-[sel2 ec,sel3 ec]
      when (isMul ec)  ยง  P3//-[sel2 ec,sel3 ec]
      when (isNeg ec)  ยง  P4//-[sel2 ec]
\end{code}
First, we wait for the scrutinee to be defined, then we generate 4 sets of constraints, one for each constructor.

\subsection{Creating symbolic values}

We have seen how we can create concrete symbolic values (using |var|, |add|, |mul|, and |neg|), but not how to create values with symbolic variables in them.

Creating these kinds of values turns out to be so useful that we introduce a type class for them:
\begin{code}
class Symbolic a where
  new :: C a
\end{code}
Here are some instances of types we have seen before:
\begin{code}
instance Symbolic Prop where
  new = newVal

instance Symbolic a => Symbolic (Arg a) where
  new = An `fmap` new

instance Symbolic a => Symbolic (Delay a) where
  new = delay new
\end{code}
We already know how to generate symbolic |Prop|s. When generating a completely general symbolic |Arg|, it has to exist (it cannot be |X|). Generating a symbolic |Delay| just delays the generation of its contents, which is how we get incrementality. Generating a symbolic tuple means generating symbolic elements.

When we make a new symbolic datatype |TypeSym|, we have to make an instance of |Symbolic| for its constructor type |TypeC|. Here is what it looks like for |ExprC|:
\begin{code}
instance Symbolic a => Symbolic (ExprC a) where
  new =  do  c <- newFin [Var,Add,Mul,Neg]
             liftM3 (Expr c) new new new
\end{code}
With the instance above, we also have |new :: C ExprSym| to our disposal.

\subsection{Copying symbolic values}

The last operation on symbolic types we need is {\em copying}. Copying is needed when we want to generate constraints that define a symbolic value |y| in terms of a given value |x|. Copying is also used a lot, and therefore we introduce a type class:
%format >>> = "\rhd"
\begin{code}
class Copy a where
  (>>>) :: a -> a -> C ()
\end{code}
The expression |x >>> y| copies |x| into |y|; it defines |y| as |x| under the current environment condition.

Here are some instances of types we have seen before:
\begin{code}
instance Copy Prop where
  p >>> q = insist (p <=> q)

instance Eq a => Copy (Fin a) where
  Fin pxs >>> v = sequence_
    [ insist (p ==> (v `is` x)) | (p,x) <- pxs ]

instance Copy a => Copy (Delay a) where
  s >>> t = wait s ยง \x -> do  y <- force t
                               x >>> y
\end{code}
For |Prop|, copying is just logical equivalence. For finite values |Fin a|, we let the propositions in the left argument imply the corresponding propositions in the right argument. This is enough because all propositions in a |Fin a| are mutually exclusive.

For |Delay a|, we wait until |s| gets defined, and as soon as this happens, we make sure |t| is defined (if it wasn't already), and copy the contents of |s| to the contents of |t|.

At this stage, it may be interesting to look at an example of a combination of |new| and |>>>|. Consider the following two |C|-expressions:
%format ยค = "\phantom"
%format /// = "\;\;\;"
%format //  = "\;"
\begin{code}
do  y <- new  ///  ===  /// do x >>> z
    x >>> y
    y >>> z   
\end{code}
Both logically mean the same thing, if |y| is not used anywhere else. The left hand side creates a new |y|, copies |x| into |y| and also copies |y| into |z|. The first copy constraint has the effect of always making sure that |y| is logically equivalent to |x| under the current environment condition. As soon as any |Delay| in |x| becomes defined, which may happen after these constraints have been generated, |y| will follow suit. And whenever |y| expands a |Delay|, |z| will follow suit. So the effect of the left hand side is the same as the right hand side.

To enable copying on symbolic datatypes |TypeSym| we need to make an instance for their corresponding |TypeC|. Here is what this looks like for |ExprC|:
%format x1
%format x2
%format b1
%format b2
\begin{code}
instance Copy a => Copy (ExprC a) where
  Expr c1 x1 a1 b1 >>> Expr c2 x2 a2 b2 =
    do  c1 >>> c2
        when (isVar c1)  ยง  do x1 >>> x2
        when (isAdd c1)  ยง  do a1 >>> a2; b1 >>> b2
        when (isMul c1)  ยง  do a1 >>> a2; b1 >>> b2
        when (isNeg c1)  ยง  do a1 >>> a2
\end{code}
We can see that copying runs the same recursive call to |>>>| multiple times in different branches. However, we should not be calling these branches, because in one general symbolic call to the above function, {\em all} ``branches'' will be executed! This means that the same recursive call will be executed several times, leading to an exponential blow-up. In Section \ref{sec:memo} we will see how to deal with this.

% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Translating programs into constraints}

%format pSym = "\mathit{p}^\dagger"
%format ASym = "\mathit{A}^\dagger"
%format BSym = "\mathit{B}^\dagger"
In this section, we explain how we can translate a program |p :: A -> B| in a simple functional programming language into a monadic program |pSym :: ASym -> C BSym| in Haskell, such that when |pSym| is run on symbolic input, it generates constraints in a SAT-solver that correspond to the behavior of |p|.

For now, we assume that the datatypes and programs we deal with are first-order. We also assume that all definitions are total, i.e.\ terminating and non-crashing. We will later have a discussion on how these restrictions can be lifted.

\subsection{The language}

We start by presenting the syntax of the language we translate. This language is very restricted syntactically, but it is easy to see that more expressive languages can be translated into this language.

Function definitions |d| and recursion can only happen on top-level. A program is a sequence of definitions |d|.
%format x1
%format xn = "\mathit{x}_n"
%format e1
%format en = "\mathit{e}_n"
%format s1
%format sn = "\mathit{s}_n"
%format K1
%format Kn = "\mathit{K}_n"
\begin{code}
d ::= f x1 ... xn = e
\end{code}
Expressions are separated into two categories: {\em simple} expressions and regular expressions. Simple expressions are constructor applications, selector functions, or variables. Regular expressions are let-expressions with a function application, case-expressions, or simple expressions.
\begin{code}
s ::=  K s1 ... sn
    |  sel s
    |  x

e ::=  let x = f s1 ... sn in e
    |  case s of
         K1 -> e1
         ...
         Kn -> en
    |  s
\end{code}
Function application can only happen inside a let-definition and only with simple expressions as arguments. Case-expressions can only match on constructors, the program has to use explicit selector functions to project out the arguments. 

\subsection{Basic translation}

%format (transr (e)) = "\llbracket" e "\rrbracket\!\!\!\Rightarrow\!\!\!"
%format (trans (e))  = "\llbracket" e "\rrbracket"
The translation revolves around the basic translation for expressions, denoted |transr e r|, where |e| is a (simple or regular) expression, and |r| is a variable. The idea is that |transr e r| is a monadic computation that will generate constraints that will put the value of the expression |e| into the variable |r|.

Given the translation for expressions, the translation for function definitions is:
\begin{code}
trans (f x1 ... xn = e) /// = /// f x1 ... xn = do  y <- new
                                                    transr e y
                                                    return y
\end{code}
To translate a function definition, we generate code that creates a new symbolic value |y|, translates |e| into |y|, and returns |y|.

The translation for simple expressions is simple, because no monadic code needs to be generated; we have pure functions for concrete data constructors and pure functions for selectors.
\begin{code}
transr s r /// = /// s >>> r
\end{code}
We simply copy the value of the simple expression into |r|.

To translate let-expressions, we use the standard monadic transformation:
\begin{code}
transr (let f s1 ... sn in e//) r /// = /// do  x <- f s1 ... sn
                                                transr e r
\end{code}
To translate case-expressions, we use |wait| to wait for the result to become defined, and then generate code for all branches.
%format isK1 = "\mathit{isK}_1"
%format isKn = "\mathit{isK}_n"
\begin{code}
transr (case s of         ///  =  ///  wait s ยง \cs ->
          K1 -> e1        ///  ยค  ///  ///   do  when (isK1 cs)  ยง  transr e1 r
          ...             ///  ยค  ///            ...
          Kn -> en //) r  ///  ยค  ///            when (isKn cs)  ยง  transr en r
\end{code}

\subsection{An example}

Consider the definition of the standard Haskell function |(++)|:
\begin{code}
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
[]      ++ ys  = ys
(x:xs)  ++ ys  = x : (xs ++ ys)
\end{code}
Applying our translation to this function and using symbolic lists, yields the following code:
\begin{code}
(++?) :: Symbolic a => ListSym a -> ListSym a -> C (ListSym a)
xs ++? ys = do  zs <- new
                wait xs ยง \cxs ->
                  when (isNil cxs) ยง
                    do  ys >>> zs
                  when (isCons cxs) ยง
                    do  vs <- sel2 cxs ++ ys
                        cons (sel1 cxs) vs >>> zs
\end{code}
An example property that we may want to find a counter example to may look like this:
\begin{code}
appendCommutative xs ys =
  do  vs <-  xs ++ ys
      ws <-  ys ++ xs
      b  <-  vs == ws
      insist (neg b)
\end{code}


\subsection{Memoization} \label{sec:memo}

When performing symbolic evaluation, much more so than when running a program on concrete values, it is very common that functions get applied to the same arguments more than once.

Memoization is good, and easy.

Show the memoized translation of functions.

\subsection{Symbolic merging of function calls}

Explain what bad things can happen if we do not do this.

Explain the idea as a program transformation. This only works if we are in a lazy language.

Explain what happens in the generated constraints.

\subsection{Dynamic termination checks}

Even if input program terminates, symbolic program may not terminate without dynamic checks.

Show example.

Add 'check'. Describe in words. Exact implementation is shown in the next section.

\subsection{Other optimizations}

Not all datatypes need to use |Delay|. If they are finite, they don't. We decided not to do it for enumeration types (e.g. |Bool|).

For definitions that contain simple expressions, we can avoid the creation of a fresh symbolic value. Instead we can translate:
\begin{code}
trans (f x1 ... xn = s) /// = /// f x1 ... xn = do  return s
\end{code}

\section{Examples}

In this section we aim to describe how our system works in practice by
looking at some examples.

\subsection{Generating sorted lists}

Assume that we are given a predicate about unique and sorted lists,
that all elements are pairwise larger than the next:

\begin{code}
usorted  ::  [Nat] -> Bool
usorted (x:y:xs)  =  x < y && usorted (y:xs)
usorted _         =  True
\end{code}

\noindent
Now we can investigate the expansion strategy by asking for |xs|
such that |usorted xs| and |length xs >= n|, given some bound |n|.
With |n|, the trace looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
xs: _
xs: (List__)
xs: (List_(List__))
xs: (List_(List_(List__)))
xs: (List_(List_(List_(List__))))
xs: (List_(List(Nat_)(List_(List__))))
xs: (List_(List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat(Nat_))(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat(Nat_))(List(Nat(Nat_))(List__))))
xs= Cons Z (Cons (S Z) (Cons (S (S Thunk_Nat)) Nil))
\end{verbatim}

All but the last lines describe a partial view of the value.
Delayed values are represented with a @_@, and other values
with their type constructor and the arguments. The
value is first expanded to be sufficiently wide, and
then the natural number elements are. Note that
no values except for the needed ones are evaluated.
We are not always that lucky as we shall see later.

Can also generate reverese and qrev lists, can generate
sorted lists with |sort xs=xs|.... Later we will look at the more difficult
|sort xs=sort ys|. Sorting stuff

\subsubsection{Terminate without example}
Also show examples of (depth-bound and/or size-bound and/or other-bound) things that terminate without example.

If we again ask for |xs|, such that |usorted xs|,
|length xs >= n|, but add that |all (< n) xs|, i.e.
the list must be sorted, it must \emph{at least}
have some length |n| (an upper bound), but also
every element must be below |n|, the system
will terminate


\subsubsection{Discussion about nub and delete}

\begin{code}
nub xs = y:y:ys
\end{code}

Note that it does not help even if the element type is finite.

\subsection{Merge sort}

\subsection{Inverting type checking}

\begin{code}
usorted  ::  [Nat] -> Bool
usorted (x:y:xs)  =  x < y && usorted (y:xs)
usorted _         =  True
\end{code}

\noindent
Now we can investigate the expansion strategy by asking for |xs|
such that |usorted xs| and |length xs > n|, given some bound |n|.
With |n|, the trace looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
xs: _
xs: (List__)
xs: (List_(List__))
xs: (List_(List_(List__)))
xs: (List_(List_(List_(List__))))
xs: (List_(List(Nat_)(List_(List__))))
xs: (List_(List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat(Nat_))(List(Nat_)(List__))))
xs: (List(Nat_)(List(Nat(Nat_))(List(Nat(Nat_))(List__))))
xs= Cons Z (Cons (S Z) (Cons (S (S Thunk_Nat)) Nil))
\end{verbatim}

All but the last lines describe a partial view of the value.
Delayed values are represented with a @_@, and other values
with their type constructor and the arguments. The
value is first expanded to be sufficiently wide, and
then the natural number elements are. Note that
no values except for the needed ones are evaluated.
We are not always that lucky as we shall see later.

Can also generate reverese and qrev lists, can generate
sorted lists with |sort xs=xs|.... Later we will look at the more difficult
|sort xs=sort ys|. Sorting stuff

\subsubsection{Terminate without example}

Sometimes it can be noticed that there is no counterexample regardless how the
program is expanded.  The simplest property when this happens is perhaps asking
for an |x| such that |x < Z|. The standard definition of |(<)| returns |False|
for any |y < Z|, so there is a contradiction in this context. This is also the
same context that the Thunk in |x| is waiting for, but since this is
unsatisfiable, it will never be expanded.

Let's return to the previous example with asking for an |xs|, such that
|usorted xs| and |length xs > n|, but with  the new constraint that |all (< n)
xs|.  So the list must be sorted, but the upper bounds on the data is only
local: namely that each element should be below |n|. The other constraint is a
lower bound on the data: that it should at least have length |n|.

When executing this, first the |length| constraint forces the program to expand
to make the list at least that long.  Then the |unsorted| predicate will make
sure that all the elements are pairwise ordered. This will make the first
element to be at least |Z|, the one after that at least |S Z| and so un until
the |n|th element. But then we will eventually enter the situation outlined
above and the |n|th element cannot expand any more, and the system terminates
cleanly with saying:

\begin{verbatim}
Contradiction!
No value found.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
and thus efficiently proving the property (for a specific choice of |n|, not for all |n|.)
So our system can be used with bounds written as boolean predicates, for instance depth.

\subsubsection{Limitations of termination discovery}

Our system is not an inductive prover and will not terminate on

\begin{code}
nub xs = y:y:ys
\end{code}

\noindent
(Note that it does not help even if the element type is finite.)

nor on:

\begin{code}
usorted (rev xs) && all (< n) xs && length xs > n
\end{code}

\noindent
it keeps expanding the tail of the list, hoping for something....

\subsubsection{Discussion about contracts checking a'la Leon}

\subsection{Merge sort}

The section discusses some optimisations that can be done
to functions with more that one recursive call.
The topic is this implementation of merge sort:

\begin{code}
msort      :: [Nat] -> [Nat]
msort []   = []
msort [x]  = [x]
msort xs   = merge (msort (evens xs)) (msort (odds xs))

merge :: [Nat] -> [Nat] -> [Nat]
merge []      ys      = ys
merge xs      []      = xs
merge (x:xs)  (y:ys)  | x <= y     = x:merge xs (y:ys)
                      | otherwise  = y:merge (x:xs) ys
\end{code}

Here, |evens, odds :: [Nat] -> [Nat]| picks ut the elements
at the even and the odd positions, respectively. 

%format x_1
%format x_2
%format x_3
%format y_1
%format y_2
%format y_3

Symbolically evaluating merge is expensive since |merge| does two recursive
calls. One observation is that evaluating |merge| from the tuple of arguments
|([x_1, x_2, ...],[y_1, y_2, ...])| will make two calls to the pairs
|([x_1, x_2, ...],[y_2, ...])| and
|([x_2, , ...],[y_1, y_2, ...])|. However, both of these will make the call
to the same symbolic lists |([x_2, ...],[y_2, ...])|. We can
avoid to twice calculate symbolic corresponding to those two merged,
by memoising the function. The second time the merge of these two lists
is requested, the saved symbolic list is instead returned.

Another observation is that the calls in |merge| can be \emph{merged} to make |merge'|:

\begin{code}
merge' :: [Nat] -> [Nat] -> [Nat]
merge' []      ys      = ys
merge' xs      []      = xs
merge' (x:xs)  (y:ys)  = hd : merge' l r
  where (hd,l,r)  | x <= y     = (x, xs, y:ys)
                  | otherwise  = (y, x:xs, ys)
\end{code}

When evaluating the program strict, these versions of merge make no difference,
but when evaluating it symbolically, the |merge'| version will make a
\emph{linear} number of calls instead of \emph{exponential} in the length of
the lists.

Our compiler can make this transformation automatically given that the
user annotates which calls in the program to collapse.

In Figure \ref{inj} the task is, given a length bound |n|, to find |xs|, |ys| of type |[Nat]| subject to:

> xs /= ys && msort xs == msort ys && length xs >= n

The runtime is considerably better for the |merge'| version, and the memoised
version of |merge| is considerably better than the unmemoised version.
The runtimes are compared to Leon and LazySmallCheck. Their 
best runtime was chosen from the |evens|-|odds| version or the more standard
|splitAt (length xs `div` 2)| version of |msort| (both favored the
latter version). It should be said that our system works worse on
that version.  

We also applied the |merge| to |merge'| transformation 
by hand for them, but this did not improve their runtime. 

\begin{figure}[htp] \centering{
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{inj.pdf}}
\caption{

and |msort xs == msort ys| with a constraint on |length xs|.

\emph{unopt} (using |merge|). The other tools are LazySmallCheck and Leon.

\subsection{Inverting type checking}

%format :-> = ":\rightarrow"
%format env = "\rho"

We will here consider a standard type-checker for 
simply typed lambda calculus. It answers whether 
a given expression has a given type, in an environment:

> tc :: [Type] -> Expr -> Type -> Bool
> tc  env  (App f x tx)  t           = tc env f (tx :-> t) && tc env x tx
> tc  env  (Lam e)       (tx :-> t)  = tc (tx:env) e t
> tc  env  (Lam e)       _           = False
> tc  env  (Var x)       t           =  case env `index` x of 
>                                         Just tx  -> tx == t 
>                                         Nothing  -> False

By now inverting this function, we can use it 
both to infer the type of a given expression,
or even synthesise programs of a given type!
For instance, we can get the S combinator
by asking for an |e| such that:

> tc [] e ((A :-> B :-> C) :-> (A :-> B) :-> A :-> C)

Upon which our tool answers this term, when pretty-printed:

\begin{code}
\x y z -> ((((\v w -> w) z) x) z) (y z)
\end{code}

This takes about 7 seconds, but as can be seen above,
it contains redexes. Interestingly, we can 
avoid getting redexes \emph{and} reduce the search space by
by adding a recursive predicate 
|nf :: Expr -> Bool|
that checks that there is no unreduced
lambda in the expression. Now, we ask
for the same as above, and that |nf e|.
With this modification, finding the s combinator,
in normal form, takes less a fraction of a second. 

Constraining the data in this way allows 
cutting away big parts of the search space (only normal 
forms). The context where the expression is not in normal
form will become inconsistent due to the predicate,
and no delayed computations are evaluated from inconsistent
contexts. This would not be the case if we up from decided on how
big our symbolic values were. So here we see a direct benefit from 
incrementally expanding the program.

Both the code for the type checker and the
normal form predicate contains calls that 
can be merged in the fashion as the merge
sort. Without merging these calls, finding the a normal 
form of the s comibator takes about a second,
and 30 seconds without the normal form predicate.

% \begin{code}
% data Expr = App Expr Expr Type | Lam Expr | Var Nat
% 
% data Type = Type :-> Type | A | B | C 
% tc  env  (App f x tx)  t           = tc env f (tx :-> t) 
%                                    && tc env x tx
% tc  env  (Lam e)       (tx :-> t)  = tc (tx:env) e t
% tc  env  (Lam e)       _           = False
% tc  env  (Var x)       t           =  case env `index` x of 
%                                         Just tx  -> tx == t 
%                                         Nothing  -> False
% \end{code}
% 
% \begin{code}
% nf :: Expr -> Bool
% nf (App (Lam _) _ _) = False
% nf (App f x _)       = nf f && nf x
% nf (Lam e)           = nf e
% nf (Var _)           = True
% \end{code}

\subsection{Regular expressions}

%format :+: = ":\!\!+\!\!:"
%format :&: = ":\!\&\!:"
%format :>: = ":>:"
%format .>. = ".\!>\!\!."

%format Meps = "\epsilon"
%format (repp (p) (i) (j)) = p "\!\{" i "," j "\}"
%format (reppp (p) (i) (j)) = "(" p ")\!\{" i "," j "\}"
%format (maxx (i) (j)) = i "\cap" j
%format (minn (i) (j)) = i "\cup" j
%format Mempset = "\emptyset"

We used an regular expression recognizer
to falsify some plausible looking regular
expression laws.

We will call the main one |prop_repeat|:

> Meps `notElem` p && s `elem` repp p i j & repp p i' j' ==> s `elem` repp p (maxx i i') (minn j j')

Here, |repp p i j| means repeat the regular expression |p| from |i| to |j| times. 
If |i > j|, then this regular expression does not recognize any string.
Conjunction of regular expressions is denoted by |&|.

This property is false for |i = 0|, |j = 1|, |i' = j' = 2|, |p = a+aa| and |s = aa|,
since |reppp (a+aa) (maxx 0 2) (minn 1 2) = reppp (a+aa) 2 1 = Mempset|.

The library has the following api:

> data RE a  = a :>: a  | a :+: a  | a :&: a 
>            | Star a   | Eps      | Nil

> step  ::  RE Token -> Token -> RE Token
> eps   ::  RE a -> Bool
> rec   ::  RE Token -> [Token] -> Bool
> rep   ::  RE Token -> Nat -> Nat -> RE Token

The |step| function does Brzozowski differentiation, |eps|
answers if the expression contains the empty string, |rec|
answers if the word is recognised, and |rep| is the
above repetition.

We can now ask our system for variables satisfying:

> not (eps p)  && rec s (rep p i j :&: repp p i' j') 
>              && not (rec (rep p (max i i') (min j j')) s)

whereupon we get the following counterexample in just over 30 seconds:

% p:  (R(R(R__(T))(R__(T))(T))(R__(T))(T))
% i:  (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% i': (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% j:  (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% j': (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% s:  (List(T)(List(T)(List(T)_)))

\begin{verbatim}
Counterexample!
p:  (Atom A :>: Atom A) :+: Atom A
i:  S (S Z)
i': S Z
j:  S (S Z)
j': S Z
s:  Cons A (Cons A Nil)
\end{verbatim}

(This conterexample is essentially the same as outlined above.)

The implementation of the regular expression library contains
lots of calls that are the same across the branches. For instance,
the |eps| function looks like this:

\begin{code}
eps :: R T -> Bool
eps Eps        = True
eps (p :+: q)  = eps p || eps q
eps (p :&: q)  = eps p && eps q
eps (p :>: q)  = eps p && eps q
eps (Star _)   = True
eps _          = False
\end{code}

Here, we could collapse all the calls |eps p| as described
in the section above, but it is actually enough to just
memoize them as they are exactly the same. (The same holds for |eps q|).
The recursive call structure of the |step| function follows
the same pattern as for |eps| and memoisation is enough there as well.

% \begin{code}
% step  :: RE Token -> Token -> RE Token
% step  (Atom a)   x  = if a == x then Eps else Nil
% step  (p :+: q)  x  =  step p x :+:  step q x
% step  (p :&: q)  x  =  step p x :&:  step q x
% step  (p :>: q)  x  =  (step p x :>: q) :+: 
%                        if eps p then step q x else Nil
% step  (Star p)   x  =  step p x :>: Star p
% step  _          x  = Nil
% \end{code}
% 
% The previous code uses the predicate |eps :: R a -> Bool|
% which answers if a regular expression recognizes 
% the empty string. We can now define the recognizer |rec|
% for an input word:
% 
% \begin{code}
% rec :: RE Token -> [Token] -> Bool
% rec p []      = eps p
% rec p (x:xs)  = rec (step p x) xs
% \end{code}
% 
% The first example we look at is 
% relating conjunction of regular expressions |(:&:)|
% and sequential composition |(:>:)|:
% 
% > not (eps p) && rec (p :&: (p :>: p)) s 
% 
% On this example, we get a counterexample after 28
% seconds, having explored the right part of the
% expression, but the list a little too far:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
% p: (R(R(R__(T))_(T))(R__(T))(T))
% s: (List(T)(List(T)(List(T)(List(T)_))))
% 
% Counterexample!
% p: Star (Atom B) :>: Atom B
% s: Cons B (Cons B Nil)
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% The second  property we looked at 
% involves iterates a regular expression
% with |iter| a number of times:
% 
% \begin{code}
% iter :: Nat -> R a -> R a
% iter Z     _ = Eps
% iter (S n) r = r :>: iter n r
% \end{code}
% 
% The property is now is trying to find such an expression
% |p|, a word |s| and two numbers |i| and |j| such that:
% 
% > i /= j && not (eps p) && rec (iter i p :&: iter j p) s
% 
% On this example we explore this: 
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
% i: (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% j: (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% p: (R(R(R__(T))_(T))(R__(T))(T))
% s: (List(T)(List(T)(List(T)_)))
% 
% Counterexample!
% i: S (S Z)
% j: S Z
% p: Star (Atom A) :>: Atom A
% s: Cons A (Cons A Nil)
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% Given this:
% 
% \begin{code}
% subtract1 :: Nat -> Nat
% subtract1 Z      = Z
% subtract1 (S x)  = x
% 
% rep :: R T -> Nat -> Nat -> R T
% rep p i      (S j)  = (cond (isZero i) :+: p) 
%                     :>: rep p (subtract1 i) j
% rep p Z      Z      = Eps
% rep p (S _)  Z      = Nil 
% \end{code}
% 
% Prove this:
% 
% > not (eps p)  && rec (rep p i j :&: rep p i' j') s 
% >              && not (rec (rep p (i `max` i') (j `min` j')))
% 
% This is what we get:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
% p8: (R(R(R__(T))(R__(T))(T))(R__(T))(T))
% i0: (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% i': (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% j0: (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% j': (Nat(Nat(Nat_)))
% s: (List(T)(List(T)(List(T)_)))
% 
% == Try solve with 74 waits ==
% Counterexample!
% p8: (Atom A :>: Atom A) :+: Atom A
% i0: S (S Z)
% i': S Z
% j0: S (S Z)
% j': S Z
% s: Cons A (Cons A Nil)

\subsection{Synthesising turing machines}

Another example we considered was a simulator
of turing machines. The tape symbols are
either empty (|O|), or |A| or |B|:

> data A = O | A | B

The actions are either halting or moving
right or left and entering a new state represented with a |Nat|:

> data Action = Lft Nat | Rgt Nat | Stp

The machine is then a function from the state (a |Nat|), and
a the symbol at the tape head |A|, to a symbol to be written
and a new head:

> type Q' = (Nat,A) -> (A,Action)

but we (currently) don't support functions we represent this 
tabulated in a list instead:

> type Q      = [((Nat,A),(A,Action))]

(This transformation from lists to tables could be
done automatically, with the addition of a default value.)
A configuration of the machine is a state, and a zipper
of the tape head: the reversed list of the symbols to
the left, and the current symbol consed on to the symbols to the right:

> type Configuration  = (Nat,[A],[A])

The |step| function advances the machine one step, which 
either terminates with the final tape, or 
ends up in a  new configuration.

> step :: Q -> Configuration -> Either [A] Configuration

The |steps| function runs |step| repeatedly
until the machine terminates.

> steps  :: Q -> Configuration -> [A]

This function may of course not terminate, so
the translated functions needs to insert a check,
as described above.

The entire machine can be run from a starting
tape, by stepping it from the starting state |Zero| with |run|:

> run         :: Q -> [A] -> [A]
> run q tape  = steps q (Zero,[],tape)

We used or system to find turing machines given an input-output pair.

One example is to find the insert function, which puts an intial |B|
to the right place in a sorted list with these input-output pairs:

> run q [A]            == [A] && 
> run q [B,A,A,A,A,B]  == [A,A,A,A,B,B]

Asking our system to find such a |q|, we get this result (pretty-printed, with
literals ints instead of Nats) in ten seconds:
 

\begin{code}
[  ((Succ Zero,         A),  (B,  Stp)),
   ((Succ (Succ Zero),  A),  (A,  Rgt (Succ (Succ Zero)))),
   ((Zero,              B),  (A,  Rgt (Succ (Succ Zero)))),
   ((Succ (Succ Zero),  B),  (B,  Lft (Succ Zero))),
   ((Zero,              A),  (A,  Stp)) ]
\end{code}

This machine contains a loop in state two, which is enters
upon reading an inital |B| (which is replaced with an |A|).
It then uses state two to skip by all the |A|s until 
it comes to a |B|, where it backtracks, and replaces
the last |A| it found with a |B|. If the tape starts with
|A| the program terminates immediately.

In the above example we found by experimentation that 
it was necessary to have no less than four A in the example,
otherwise it the returned machine would "cheat" and instead
of creating a loop, just count.

In this example it is crucial to use |check| to
be able to handle the possibly non-terminating |steps| function.
In systems like Reach \cite{reach}, it is possile
to limit the expansion of the program on the number of unrollings
of recursive functions. Our method with |check| does exactly
this, but there is no need to decide beforehand how many
unrollings are needed, it is all done dynamically.

\section{Experimental evaluation}

And again, there is the merge sort times.

Regexp was evaluated against leon and
lazy small check. leon timed out on all of them

We evaluated the type checker against 
lazy small check with a timeout of 300s.

Turing machines were evaluated...
LSC timed out.

\section{Discussion and Future Work}

Make choices of which constructor arguments to merge less arbitrary.

Make choices of which function calls to merge automatic.

Make choice of what to memoize automatic.

Higher-order functions.

Laziness.

Crashing programs (and respecting laziness).

Targets a la Reach.

Using SMT. Integers (trivial, but how to do recursion over integers that terminates? add check everywhere?). Equality and functions can be used to encode constructor functions, selector functions, function application. This is what Leon does. Gain?

If-then-else vs. new and equalHere.

Using BDDs. Incrementality would not work. But otherwise it is not a bad idea. Should use the if-then-else method. The only variables would be the ones created in the input.

\section{Conclusions}

This is a hard problem.

We have found a niche, works well (and better than others) for cases where the SAT problem is not too big, and one gains something from combinatorial search power.

Our method does not work well when: (1) Expansion does the wrong thing (in which case you can do this by hand), (2) Expansion is too careful, too many small steps, (3) the SAT-problem becomes too big (all intermediate datastructures are remembered), or (4) the SAT-problem is too hard. 

It is perhaps surprising that this is even possible; coding a search problem over a program containing recursive functions over recursive datastructures in terms of a SAT-problem, which is inherently finite.
